    	<h5>We Believe in Compliments</h5>
    	<p>We at Make My Day believe that affirmations help us face our lives with confidence and courage. Compliments add to the suit of armor that shelters our souls from the rigors of the daily grind and give us the courage to face new challenges with our best foot forward. Our associates travel the world searching for just the right compliments and pride ourselves in providing the most fitting complement to meet your needs. So, send someone in your life a the perfect compliment to help them as they journey through their day. If you would like to send someone a compliment, please see our soulful offerings on the products page.</p>
    	<p>Perhaps you have not received a compliment lately and just need a little boost. You can send a compliment to yourself and feel the soothing protection of another layer of positive affirmation on your sensitive soul: a priveleged reminder how what a wonderful human being your are and the difference you  make daily.</p>
    	<p>or, perhaps compliments are not your goal right now. Perhaps your ego-driven coworker needs to be politely reminded of their fallability or a hurtful spouse needs to understand your anger: please visit our back handed compliments page to meet any pointed communication needs you may have.</p>
