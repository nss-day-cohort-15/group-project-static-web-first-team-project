  <p class="companyDescription">So by now you've probably perused our list of compliments and got that ego boost you needed to make it through the day...
  perhaps compliments are not your goal right now. Perhaps your ego-driven coworker needs to be politely reminded of their fallability or a hurtful spouse needs to understand your anger.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="companyDescription">Lets fix that by sending your "favorite" person one of our flavorful, baby powder covered, bonafide backhanded compliments, or a straight up insult, and make your own day!</p>
